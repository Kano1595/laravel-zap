# Availability Features Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

The availability checking methods (`isAvailableAt`, `getAvailableSlots`, `getNextAvailableSlot`) were not working correctly with recurring schedules. The main issues were:

1. **Recurring schedules not being recognized**: When checking availability for a specific date/time, the system was only looking for actual database records of periods, but recurring schedules don't store individual instances in the database - they generate them on-demand.

2. **Date comparison issues**: The `forDate` scope in the Schedule model was not properly handling string date comparisons with Carbon date objects.

## Root Cause

The `isAvailableAt` method in `HasSchedules.php` was using a simple database query that looked for overlapping periods, but this approach doesn't work for recurring schedules because:

- Recurring schedules only store the base periods (with the schedule's start_date)
- The recurring instances are generated dynamically by the `ConflictDetectionService`
- The availability checking methods were not using this dynamic generation logic

## Solution

### 1. Fixed Date Comparison in Schedule Model

**File**: `src/Models/Schedule.php`

```php
public function scopeForDate(Builder $query, string $date): void
{
    $checkDate = \Carbon\Carbon::parse($date); // Convert string to Carbon

    $query->where('start_date', '<=', $checkDate)
        ->where(function ($q) use ($checkDate) {
            $q->whereNull('end_date')
                ->orWhere('end_date', '>=', $checkDate);
        });
}
```

### 2. Completely Rewrote Availability Checking Logic

**File**: `src/Models/Concerns/HasSchedules.php`

The new `isAvailableAt` method now:

1. **Finds all relevant schedules** for the given date using the fixed `forDate` scope
2. **Checks each schedule individually** using a new `scheduleBlocksTime` method
3. **Handles recurring schedules properly** by checking if the date should have a recurring instance
4. **Uses the same logic as ConflictDetectionService** for determining recurring instances

```php
public function isAvailableAt(string $date, string $startTime, string $endTime): bool
{
    // Get all active schedules for this model on this date
    $schedules = \Zap\Models\Schedule::where('schedulable_type', get_class($this))
        ->where('schedulable_id', $this->getKey())
        ->active()
        ->forDate($date)
        ->with('periods')
        ->get();

    foreach ($schedules as $schedule) {
        if ($this->scheduleBlocksTime($schedule, $date, $startTime, $endTime)) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    return true;
}
```

### 3. Added Recurring Schedule Logic

The new implementation includes helper methods that mirror the logic in `ConflictDetectionService`:

- `scheduleBlocksTime()`: Determines if a specific schedule blocks a time period
- `recurringScheduleBlocksTime()`: Handles recurring schedule logic
- `shouldCreateRecurringInstance()`: Determines if a recurring instance should exist on a given date
- `timePeriodsOverlap()`: Checks if two time periods overlap

## Test Coverage

Created comprehensive tests in `tests/Feature/RecurringScheduleAvailabilityTest.php` that cover:

- ✅ The exact scenario reported by the user
- ✅ Daily recurring schedules
- ✅ Weekly recurring schedules (including specific days)
- ✅ Monthly recurring schedules
- ✅ Schedule end date boundaries
- ✅ Multiple overlapping recurring schedules
- ✅ Edge case time boundaries
- ✅ `getAvailableSlots` with recurring schedules
- ✅ `getNextAvailableSlot` with recurring schedules

## Example Usage

Now these methods work correctly with recurring schedules:

```php
$user = User::find(1);

// Create a recurring schedule starting tomorrow afternoon
$schedule = Zap::for($user)
    ->named('Weekend Work')
    ->from('2025-03-15') // Tomorrow
    ->addPeriod('14:00', '18:00')
    ->weekly(['saturday', 'sunday'])
    ->save();

// ✅ Now works correctly - returns false during scheduled time
$isAvailable = $user->isAvailableAt('2025-03-15', '14:00', '16:00');
// Returns: false (user is NOT available)

// ✅ Returns true before scheduled time
$isAvailable = $user->isAvailableAt('2025-03-15', '09:00', '12:00');
// Returns: true (user is available)

// ✅ getAvailableSlots now respects recurring schedules
$slots = $user->getAvailableSlots('2025-03-15', '09:00', '19:00', 60);
// Correctly shows afternoon slots as unavailable

// ✅ getNextAvailableSlot works with recurring schedules
$nextSlot = $user->getNextAvailableSlot('2025-03-15', 120, '09:00', '17:00');
// Finds next available 2-hour slot considering recurring schedule
```

## Backward Compatibility

✅ All existing functionality remains unchanged
✅ Non-recurring schedules continue to work exactly as before
✅ All existing tests pass
✅ No breaking changes to the API

## Performance Considerations

The new implementation is efficient because:
- It only processes schedules that are active and within the date range
- It uses the same recurring logic as the existing conflict detection system
- It short-circuits on the first blocking schedule found
- Database queries are optimized with proper indexes
